# Hello-World
This is my first repository  
My name is Nicolas. I came across Git and Github a couple of months ago.
I never got around to learning it as I was busy with work. I am now unemployed for one week until I take on my next job,.
I will learn Git and Github throughout the week. 
Let's get started
